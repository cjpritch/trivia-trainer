## Description
Trivia Trainer is an application that generates randomized trivia questions for the user based on their selections. The user has a choice of the number of trivia questions, category types, or even to randomly generate questions from every category. When the “start training” button is pressed, the questions associated with the user selections are displayed, along with a button to reveal the answer. Trivia Trainer can be used as a way to practice for formal trivia nights, or as a game.
